# mb2-thermometer: display current (chip) temperatures
Bart Massey 2023

This code prints the current temperature of chips on the
MicroBit v2 in Â°F once per second.  The LSM303AGR
temperature unit and the CPU temperature unit are supported.

* The `main` branch uses the `lsm303agr` crate for the LSM303AGR.

* The `twim` branch does raw i2c for the LSM303AGR to
  demonstrate that process.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the authors of the `lsm303agr` crate. It is a
really nice interface to that device.

While this code was written without reference to the
examples of accelerometer and magnetometer use in the Rust
Embedded Discovery Book for the Microbit v2, those examples
were definitely the inspiration for writing the initial
version of this.
